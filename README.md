Project: Writing a Data Scientist Blog Post
Key Steps for the Project
- Feel free to be creative with your solutions, but do follow the CRISP-DM process in finding your solutions.
- Pick a dataset, as mentioned on the previous page.
- Pose at least three questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.
- Create a Jupyter Notebook, using any associated packages you'd like, to:
  > Prepare data:
       . Gather necessary data to answer your questions
       . Handle categorical and missing data
  > Provide insight into the methods you chose and why you chose them
  > Analyze, Model, and Visualize
  > Provide a clear connection between your business questions and how the data answers them
Communicate your business insights:
  > Create a Github repository to share your code and data wrangling/modeling techniques, with a technical audience in mind
  > Create a blog post to share your questions and insights with a non-technical audience

Project Deliverables:

There are two deliverables required for project completion.
  > A Github repository for your code.
    Your Github repository must have the following contents:
    .  A README.md file that communicates
          The libraries used
          The motivation for the project
          The files in the repository with a small description of each
          A summary of the results of the analysis,
          And necessary acknowledgments
    .  Your code in a Jupyter notebook, with appropriate comments, analysis, and documentation.
    .  You may also provide any other necessary documentation you find necessary.

  > A blog post of your findings.
    For the blog post, pick a platform of your own choice. For example, it can be on your website, a Medium post (Josh's sample report(opens in a new tab) on How Do YOU Become A Developer?), or a Github blog post.
    Your blog must provide the following:
    .  A clear and engaging title and image.
    .  Your questions of interest.
    .  Your findings for those questions with a supporting statistic(s), table, or visual.
    Note: The post should not dive into technical details or difficulties of the analysis; this should be saved for Github. The post should be understandable for non-technical people from many fields.

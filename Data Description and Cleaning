I chose  Stack Overflow Survey - Multiple Years for my project because I am interested in finding trends and changes among the developer community.
Stack Overflow survey data for the years 2011-2024 is located here: https://survey.stackoverflow.co/
The number of questions and respondents change from year to year, so it is important to standardize the datasets as much as possible. 

First, we need to make sure that each dataset has a schema. Datafiles for the years 2016+ already come with a schema file, so we need to process data for the years 2011-2015.
